# AnswerIT - Universal Tab Switch Detection Bypass & AI Answer Generator

This userscript enhances learning platforms by disabling tab switch detection and providing a multi-provider AI answer generator. It lets you navigate away from assessment tabs without triggering warnings and offers a modern, intuitive interface to generate answers using Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic models.

## ‚ú® Features

### ü§ñ Multi-Provider AI Answer Generator
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Use Google Gemini (free), OpenAI (GPT-4o), or Anthropic (Claude) models
- **Real-time Streaming**: See answers generate live (see note below for Tampermonkey)
- **Smart Caching**: Answers are cached for instant reuse
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Handles API/network issues with clear feedback
- **Auto-Run Mode**: Optionally generate answers automatically when questions change

### üéõÔ∏è Modern Interface
- **Popup UI**: Responsive, themeable popup with drag, resize, and snap
- **Step-by-Step Setup**: Tabbed configuration for each provider, instant API key testing
- **Direct Insertion**: Insert answers into input fields with one click
- **Custom Prompts**: Add your own instructions for the AI

### üîß Easy Setup & Configuration
- **Tabbed Setup Page**: Configure Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic keys in a single place
- **Visual API Testing**: Test each key with instant feedback
- **Persistent Settings**: Preferences and keys are saved locally

## üåê Supported Platforms

## üì• Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (Recommended)
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Popular, but see note below)
2. **Install AnswerIT**
   - [Install Script](https://github.com/NytLyt512/Userscripts/raw/refs/heads/main/AnswerIT/AnswerIT_Universal-Tab-Switch-Detection-Bypass-and-AI-Answer-Generator.user.js)

        - [Configuration Page](https://NytLyt512.github.io/Userscripts/AnswerIT/configure.html)

> **Note:**
> - **Tampermonkey Bug:** Due to a known bug in Tampermonkey on Chromium browsers, model responses will not stream in real-time (you'll only see the final answer after generation). For full streaming support, use **Violentmonkey**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üîë API Key Setup
- **Gemini (Free):** [Get Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- **OpenAI (Paid):** [Get Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic (Paid):** [Get Key](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)

Enter your keys in the tabbed setup page. Each provider can be tested and saved individually. All settings are stored locally in your browser.

### üé® Preferences
- **Hotkey**: Default is `Alt + A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + A` (Mac)
- **Theme**: Light, dark, or auto
- **Editable Output**: Optionally edit AI output before inserting

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Detection Bypass**: Neutralizes tab-switch detection on supported platforms
2. **Question Detection**: Finds and processes questions (text, images, code)
3. **Model Selection**: Choose Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic
4. **Streaming Response**: (If supported) See answers as they generate
5. **Direct Insertion**: Insert answers with one click

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Double-check for typos, extra spaces, or expired keys
- **Streaming Not Working**: Use Violentmonkey for real-time streaming (see note above)
- **UI Not Appearing**: Refresh the page, check supported sites, or ensure your userscript manager is enabled
- **Other Issues**: [Report on GitHub](https://github.com/NytLyt512/Userscripts/issues/new?title=[AnswerIT])
